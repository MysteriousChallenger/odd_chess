#  **Odd Chess is a Chess Server built for the F2019 ICS-60 course @ UCI**  
### Unfortunately, there is no live version. Free trials ran out


Run it locally by:
- cloning this repository  
- then activating the python env by running ".../odd_chess/pyenv/scripts/activate"  
- then running the server with: "python manage.py runserver"  
- And make sure to keep localhost:8000 and localhost:80 free.

  
### Quick Summary:
- Written in Python using the Django library
- Graphics mostly by Bootstrap and Chessboard.js
- Chess logic by Chess.js
